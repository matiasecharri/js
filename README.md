# visualizer_00
A futuristic/minimalist music visualizer. Made with: html5, css3, javascript vanilla. 

The idea of this app is to provide the user with a different experience, with a futuristic and minimalist aesthetic at the same time. In addition to that, it adds an extra touch through additional interactions such as changes in the visualizers based on pauses, changes in the document title according to page interactions, and a dark/light mode that also sets a default mode based on the user's time.
